Lounge access is a key part of the premium travel experience, and understanding lounge demand is crucial for British Airways (BA) to maintain high standards while optimizing space and resources. As the airline plans for future operations at Heathrow Terminal 3, it’s important to anticipate demand across different types of lounge access, each associated with varying levels of customer loyalty and travel class.

As BA plans for the future, especially with changes in flying schedules and fleet strategy, it's important to forecast how many passengers will be eligible to use each lounge on a typical day. However, future schedules can be unpredictable, which means we need a modeling approach that is both flexible and scalable.

That’s where you come in. Your job is to create a lookup table that BA can use to estimate lounge eligibility percentages across different flight groupings. This will allow the business to anticipate lounge demand without needing exact flight or aircraft details.

To do this well, you’ll need to think critically about how to group flights in a meaningful way—by time of day, route type, or regional destination, for example, and apply logical assumptions to estimate how many travelers fall into each lounge tier. These estimates will help the Airport Planning team better understand where lounge investments may be needed as operations evolve.

In short, your table and justification will help translate data into decisions—and ensure BA continues to deliver a seamless experience for its most valued customers.
